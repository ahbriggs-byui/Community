            <h1>Sleep Cycles</h1>
            <p>When you sleep, you cycle through two phases of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. The cycle starts over every 80 to 100 minutes. Usually there are four to six cycles per night.<sup><a href ="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep/stages-of-sleep#:~:text=When%20you%20sleep%2C%20you%20cycle,wake%20up%20briefly%20between%20cycles.">1</sup></a></p>
            <ul>
                <li>N-REM Stage 1: This is the lightest stage of sleep and typically occurs right after falling asleep. This stage is only present for 1-5 minutes and has the least amount of time spent in it.  <sub><a href =”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/”>2</a><sub></li>
                <li>N-REM Stage 2: This is the stage of sleep you spend the most amount of time in. This is where the brain consolidates memory and processes all the information that was learned through the course of the day and the actions that were done.</li>
                <li>N-REM Stage 3: This is the deepest stage of sleep achieved during a night's rest. This stage is characterized by slow brain waves, and lowered arousal potential. During this stage the body repairs and regrows damaged tissues, bones and muscle. <sub><a href =”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/”>2</a><sub></li>
                <li>REM: During REM the brain's activity mirrors the awake brain. This is when dreams and nightmares occur. <sub> <a href =”https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/12148-sleep-basics”>3</a></sub></li>

            <h1>Adequate Sleep Times</h1>
            <p>Sleep is essential for people of all ages. The amount of sleep that people need varies from age to age and from person to person. As we age, our need for sleep decreases but never goes away. Below is a table from The National Sleep Foundation that outlines some of the general guidelines for the amount of sleep each age group should be receiving each night. With the presence of sleeping disorders, or a demanding work schedule, these hours are sometimes hard to get. In the long run, if you feel rested after a night's sleep, you probably got enough sleep that night.</p>

            <h1>Sleep Disorders</h1>
            <p>There are a variety of sleep disorders present in our society. Listed down below are some of the common disorders that affect people on a daily basis. Sleeping disorders can affect people by disrupting the ability to sleep, impacting the effectiveness of sleep received, and impacting physical and mental health throughout the lifespan.</p>

            <div class="sleepdisorders">
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorder</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Etiology: The body’s internal clock does not match up to the external environmental clock causing the individual to have improper sleep times. Disturbances in light-dark cycle from shift work, jet lag, irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorders and other patterns that disrupt an individual's natural sleep cycle cause this in people of all ages.<sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878747923011790">2</sup></a></p>
                    <p>Treatment: The goal of treatment is to realign the body’s circadian rhythm with the desired schedule. This is done through light therapy, melatonin, medications, and/or chronotherapy.</p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Insomnia</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Etiology: The difficulty falling or staying asleep. The diagnosis criteria include at least three days of bad sleep a week for the past three or months. This is the second most diagnosed sleeping disorder.<sup><a href ="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ene.14784?casa_token=g1B-hoctAogAAAAA%3ARx5I_XhBK67bWn21U0fBLYo6jy0Km8NAHafGA69veMSgpz2tTDnCRf6ViFgCP2rxjQx7qRXT5I20A0s2LA">3</sup></a></p>
                    <p>Treatment: The treatments for insomnia include cognitive-behavioural therapy and medication</p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Narcolepsy</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Etiology: Characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy is characterized by individuals going immediately into REM sleep rather than non-REM stage one. Narcolepsy can also be accompanied by cataplexy, which is a brief involuntary loss of muscle control following strong positive emotions. Narcolepsy is diagnosed through a doctor ordered sleep study.<sup><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.13631?casa_token=gpF1EA2pmOYAAAAA%3AuD-LPPlDPc90MuyAk1rghBujlDNdt-nL8Fl9mMIgn6F_57RS2QRCWPt9eLdlQ4MxJC9RhQx0cj8_4mSA7g">4</a></sup></p>
                    <p>Treatment: Current treatments aim to treat symptoms. Medications to improve wakefulness during daytime hours and good sleep hygiene are the common modalities of treatment</p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Obstructive Sleep Apnea</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Etiology: A sleep disorder that affects up to 1 in 3 individuals on a nightly basis. It is characterized by periods of hypoxia (low oxygen) caused by obstruction of the individual's airway.<sub><a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000988">4</a></sub></p>
                    <p>Treatment: A wide variety of treatments and lifestyle modifications can improve the degree of sleep apnea. Some of these treatments include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), weight loss, blood pressure management, positional therapy, and in certain situations surgery.</p>
                </div>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Restless Leg Syndrome</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Etiology: A common sensory-neural disorder that is characterized by the persistent need to move, more often found at night or with periods of rest.<sub><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2009.02159.x">5</a></sub></p>
                    <p>Treatment: Aside from movement itself, the most common treatments are pharmacological in nature. Medications such as levodopa, dopamine agonist, opioids, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs and iron supplements may be prescribed to decrease pain and neurologic symptoms.</p>
                </div>
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Sleep Paralysis</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Etiology: A sleep disorder that is associated with an incomplete awakening where the body retains some of the states of REM sleep despite being awake. This leads to a feeling of an “awake” brain being trapped in an “asleep” body.<sub><a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/full/10.5664/jcsm.9056">6</a></sub></p>
                    <p>Treatment:Managing sleep paralysis is a complicated matter as the exact cause of it is unknown. Some of the current treatment strategies include: medications that prevent REM sleep, management of existing mental health and sleep conditions, improving sleep hygiene, and decreasing stress.<sub><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21974-sleep-paralysis">7</a></sub></p>

                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Somnambulism (Sleepwalking)</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Etiology: The act of getting up and performing activities while not awake.<sub><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sleepwalking/">8</a></sub></p>
                    <p>Treatment: There is not a specific treatment currently available for sleepwalking. There are recommendations that have been know to help in some small way. Following a regular bedtime routine, make sure that room is dark, limiting caffeine, and relaxing before bed can help improve sleep hygiene.</p>
